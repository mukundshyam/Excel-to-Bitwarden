# Excel-to-Bitwarden
A python-based app to transfer passwords from an excel sheet to the open-source Bitwarden password manager. 

Run the file titled Converter.exe after installing the Excel_To_Bitwarden_Converter.exe onto your computer. 
Make sure to import the resulting Excel file as a "Firefox" format, after converting it into a csv. 
Download the executable from my website - https://mukundshyam.wordpress.com/coding/

Thanks!
